    <p>Being a true Miamian, Joshua was born on September 6 in South Miami. Briefly, he lived internationally in Central America
      for a little over a year before turning back to the United States at the age of five. Growing up in Miami, Joshua has been
      able to experience a variety of educational and professional opportunities. During his college years, Joshua attended
      Florida International University for his undergraduate studies. Originally, his passion was communication studies, but decided
      to pursue a degree in criminal justice with a minor in political science. This decision opened opportunities for Joshua, as
      he interned in the City Manager's office with the City of Miami Beach, and later went on to become a staffer for the
      U.S. House of Representatives post-graduation. </p>
      <p>During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic however, the opportunity to return to
      return to school intrigued Joshua, as he found himself continuing to embrace tasks that intertwined with communications.
      By spring of 2021, Joshua began studying Mass Communications at the University of Florida, enrolled in part of their
      College of Journalism online program. This shift in educational and professional aspirations gained Joshua the opportunity
      to apply and successfully be accepted in an internship program with a South Florida professional sports team, as a valued
      member of their Communications and Public Relations Department. Joshua is expected to graduate from the University of Florida
      in Fall of 2022 and is looking forward to continue his individual growth in an ever-evolving market.</p>
